# Stock Portfolio Analyzer

The Stock Portfolio Analyzer is an easy to use open-source Python application that allows users to upload CSVs of stock trades and view their portfolioâ€™s P&L, Net Asset Value, volatility, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratio over time.
The application reads the user's portfolio into a SQLite3 database and scrapes the web for real-world historical stock prices of the involved tickers. It also downloads the treasury bill rates necessary for computing the risk-free rate for the Sharpe ratio. 

The portfolio calculates Net Asset Value across time efficiently using through the use of matrix multiplication and NumPy broadcasting while accounting for currency conversion (USD and CAD are currently supported). 

The analyzer also empowers users with advanced risk management tools, including Value at Risk (VaR) and efficient frontier analysis.

All this data is presented on an intuitive, easy to use Streamlit dashboard for users to view an in-depth analysis of their portfolio.

## Architecture

## Components
The analyzer consists of four primary components:

### 1. DataSource
#### dummy_trades.py
Randomly generates a valid dummy trading portfolio with the following stocks between 2022-01-01 and 2022-12-31, ignoring all weekends and market holidays -- 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB', "RY.TO", "SHOP.TO", "BNS.TO", "TD.TO", "ENB.TO". A "valid" portfolio is one that never tries to sell more shares of a particular stock than it holds. The output file will be written to data/trades.csv. Be careful if you do not want this overwritten!

You can skip this step if you can supplement your own trades.csv, as long as it follows the specified format. Please refer to the 'How to Use' section for formatting examples. 

### 2. DataManager:
#### data_loader.py
Populates the local SQLite3 database of prices with the columns date, time, ticker, price, and currency, by calling the web scraper with the list of tickers to download data for and the appropriate date range. Only scrapes for tickers which the database does not currently have prices in the range for.
Will also call the scraper to collect the treasury bill rates to compute the risk-free rate for computing Sharpe ratios, and the CAD/USD exchange rates.


#### web_scraper.py
Web scraper for the S&P 500 and Toronto exchange (TSX) using yfinance. Accepts a list of tickers to scrape for and a date range to query between, and uploads the results to the SQLite3 database and returns the results as a dataframe.
Will also scrape for the treasury bill rates to compute the risk-free rate for computing Sharpe ratios, and the CAD/USD exchange rates.
You can replace this with your own web scraper to procure the required data.

### 3. PortfolioAnalyzer:
#### controller.py
Manages the communication layer between the prices.csv & trades.csv files with the various analyzers. 

#### analyzer.py
Base class supporting different preprocessing, reformatting, interpolation, and analytical functions, and skeleton for analyze() and display() to be overridden by subclasses.

#### nav_analyzer.py
Computes portfolio Net Asset Value by leverages matrix multiplication and NumPy broadcasting to optimize calculations.

#### pnl_analyzer.py
Computes portfolio net P&L, unrealized P&L, and realized P&L, for both the user portfolio and the dummy portfolio.

#### risk_analyzer.py
Computes portfolio volatility, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratio over time. Uses the dummy portfolio as a benchmark and computes Value at Risk (VaR) at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals. Also performs an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression between the user and dummy portfolio using scikit-learn, yielding various statistics such as R-squared. 

### 4. Dashboard: 
#### dash.py
A streamlit dashboard to serve as the interface with users. Visualizes the data from the analyzer and manages the communication between the frontend and backend.


## How to Use
Follow these steps to use the Stock Portfolio Analyzer:

1. Clone this git repository locally and launch a python virtual environment (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks).
2. Use your favorite package manager (I use pip) to install the popular yfinance, Pandas, NumPy, Requests, and BeautifulSoup libraries. 
3. Upload your trading portfolio as a CSV file with the columns date, ticker, quantity, to the /data/ directory. If you do not have one, you can randomly generate one with the DataSource/dummy_trades.py script.
4. Execute the Streamlit Dashboard in dash.py by running ```streamlit run dash.py```.
5. Feel free to customize and integrate the Stock Portfolio Analyzer into your own projects.

## Future Work
This project can be extended to improve robustness, flexibility, accuracy, reliability, and usefulness. Here are just some of my ideas:
1. Intraday Analysis: This analyzer provides insight on a per-day level of granularity. In real world scenarios, this constraint is very restrictive -- consider adding scraping functionality on a per-30 minute time basis (or more frequent!) to also conduct the same analysis on (yfinance supports this).
2. Transaction Costs: This analyzer overlooks transaction costs such as brokerage fees, commissions, exchange fees, and bid-ask spreads. These costs can eat into profits and impact the overall performance of a trading strategy or portfolio. Consider introducing a configurable "transaction fee" constant which deducts from profits and assets linearly with number of trades.
3. Order Types and Timing: This analyzer only accepts portfolios of market orders. However, in practice, traders use various types of orders, such as limit orders, stop-loss orders, trailing stops, or iceberg orders. The timing of order placement and cancellation, as well as the order routing mechanism, can also influence trading outcomes.
4. Support for more diverse portfolios: To improve the robustness and accuracy of the backtester should be diversifying the stock portfolio and adding more foreign currencies from other exchanges. This may include adding additional web scrapers and sourcing to the DataManager. It also reduced dependency on the yfinance API.
